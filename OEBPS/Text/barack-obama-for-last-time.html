    <h1>Barack Obama, for the last time</h1><time>Wednesday, November 12, 2008 at 7:21 PM</time>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p>Barack Obama is <a href="http://media.newsbusters.org/stories/obama-spokesman-says-obama-ready-rule-day-1.html">ready to rule</a>! And truth may be stranger than fiction &mdash; but the Onion is <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/international_con_man_barack_obama">funnier than UR</a>.</p>

    <p>Seriously, folks, it&rsquo;s already evident from his first week in office (since presidential power is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presidential-Modern-Presidents-Richard-Neustadt/dp/002922795X">primarily persuasive</a>, the &ldquo;-elect&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean much) that President Obama is exactly what I guessed: nothing. A Gatsby, a Zelig, a warm breeze in a suit. A bright, but completely characterless and forgettable, young man, with an unusual but hardly unique talent for reading speeches on TV. In short, America&rsquo;s new anchorman.</p>

    <p>Once again, America has re-elected her permanent government. Of course that was the only option on the ballot &mdash; as it has been since Wendell Willkie. There&rsquo;s no need to worry at all. Nothing significant in Washington has changed, will change, or can possibly change.</p>

    <p>For the next four years, public policy will flow smoothly from America&rsquo;s universities to her agencies, unimpeded by Neanderthal populism or corporate corruption. Oh, no. All the populism will be of the fashionable, happy-clappy, Starbucks Unitarian flavor. The corruption will be communist &mdash; with a small &lsquo;c,&rsquo; of course.</p>

    <p>I feel like I have a good handle on the future under our new alien overlord, <a href="http://craptocracy.blogspot.com/2008/11/barry-obannon-i-remember-him.html">President O&rsquo;Bannon</a>, because I live in San Francisco. As it happens, San Francisco is already governed by &ldquo;progressives.&rdquo; This turns out to be much the same as being governed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Lewis_Brown,_Jr.">Willie Brown</a>, except slightly funnier.</p>

    <p>For our last words on the controversy of Obama&rsquo;s background, I would like to direct your attention to <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=7469&amp;volume_id=398&amp;issue_id=405&amp;volume_num=43&amp;issue_num=07&amp;l=1">this article</a> in our local progressive rectangle of joy, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Guardian">Bay Guardian</a>. In case you are unfamiliar with the Bay Guardian, it was founded in the &rsquo;60s, its politics are somewhere to the left of Mao and the right of Kim Jong Il, and it is the sponsor of San Francisco&rsquo;s progressive supervisor coalition. Its longstanding hobbyhorse, its perma-Grail, its New Jerusalem, is its campaign to seize the San Francisco electrical system, which unhappily for the local candle industry never seems to quite make it past 40% on the ballot.</p>

    <p>The entire piece is hilarious and well worth a read, although it may be too choked with local minutia for UR&rsquo;s international cosmopolitan audience. However, I was particularly struck by the following passage:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>But make no mistake about it: electing Barack Obama was a progressive victory. Although he never followed the entire progressive line in his policy positions, he was, and is, the creature of a strong progressive movement that can rightly claim him as its standard-bearer.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I love that word. <em>Creature</em>. American communism and its black pets, in one word. <em>Creature</em>.</p>

    <p>UR is not a &ldquo;political&rdquo; blog and will hopefully have few occasions to mention President Obama, but he is the President of the United States. He is not a member of the kitchen staff. And UR is at least respectful enough to know the difference.</p>

    <p>Indeed I am confident that &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; will be quickly disappointed in President Obama. He may be a man of no character, but he at least has to shave in the morning. He cannot be entirely without stones, and I can&rsquo;t imagine he sees himself as any kind of a lackey, servant, or &ldquo;creature.&rdquo; He is playing in a different league now. His old SDS friends will have to go through proper channels if they want to reserve a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. We&rsquo;ll certainly see a fair bit of progressive wack coming out of the White House, but I&rsquo;d be surprised if we get anything as deliciously educational as, say, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/say_no_to_rfk.php">RFK Jr. in the Cabinet</a>.</p>

    <p>To be as precise as possible: the past relationship between Barack Obama and America&rsquo;s most dangerous and powerful nest of murderous political psychopaths, the so-called &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; movement, is not of any practical importance for the future. Basically, they thought they were using him, whereas in fact he was using them. It is never too hard to con a progressive.</p>

    <p>(Isn&rsquo;t there something just wonderfully true about the Onion&rsquo;s portrayal of Barack Obama as international grand master of the con? Doesn&rsquo;t the O remind you a little of Leonardo diCaprio in <em>Catch Me If You Can</em>, a cocky young man at home in any disguise? The age is different, the face is different, but the smooth is the same.)</p>

    <p>Also, speaking of UR&rsquo;s audience, this whole sordid Obama business attracted a variety of traffic from a variety of Internet Mos Eisleys, including but not limited to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Republic">Free Republic</a>.</p>

    <p>Dear wingnut Freepers, welcome, but please be aware that UR is basically the opposite of Free Republic. For one thing, we are neither Republicans nor republicans. We are monarchists &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism">Jacobites</a>, to be exact. Or at least I am, anyway. For another, UR welcomes all points of view, and in particular has a longstanding population of valuable and respected commenters who only just happen to be moonbat libtards. We are trying to convert these people. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;outreach.&rdquo; Please don&rsquo;t screw it up.</p>

    <p>Let me also reiterate the UR comment policy, which is that you can say anything, as long as it is meaningful, articulate, and generally contributes to the discussion. Just agreeing with the post, or with another comment, is not a contribution. Inane chatter, flamage, etc, is to be avoided at all costs. I have seen UR described as having the smartest commenters on the net, and I would like to keep it that way.</p>

    <p>And for those who just cannot get enough of this stuff, I have been picking on Professor Burke again. See <a href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?p=671">here</a>, and the previous couple threads. The good professor no doubt feels like he&rsquo;s been ambushed by the Internet version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_Brooks">Preston Brooks</a>. But how else are we to rid ourselves of the Cathedral? My solution: hit it very hard in the head with a baseball bat. Not exactly imaginative, I understand, but it feels good on the hands and makes a nice big soggy sound.</p>
